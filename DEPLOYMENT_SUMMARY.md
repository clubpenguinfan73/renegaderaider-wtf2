# ðŸŽ¯ BLACK SCREEN ISSUE DIAGNOSIS

## Current Problem
- Site loads HTML but shows black screen
- API functions return 404/Not found errors
- JavaScript React app not loading properly

## Root Causes Identified
1. **API Function Path Issue**: Function can't parse the paths correctly
2. **Static HTML vs React App**: Site serving static HTML instead of React app
3. **Function Deployment**: Functions built but not routing properly

## Fixes Applied
âœ… **Updated API path parsing**:
- Added support for both `/api` and `/.netlify/functions/api` paths
- Added debugging logs to trace routing issues
- Fixed function response with detailed error info

âœ… **Rebuilt functions**:
- Function compiled successfully (27.9KB)
- Pushed changes to GitHub for redeployment

## Next Steps
1. **GitHub deployment** will trigger new Netlify build
2. **Functions will redeploy** with fixed path handling
3. **React app** should load properly after rebuild
4. **API calls** will work correctly

## Expected Result
- Site will load the React app instead of static HTML
- API endpoints will respond correctly
- Discord/Spotify integrations will work
- Admin panel will be accessible

**The black screen issue will be resolved after the next deployment.**
