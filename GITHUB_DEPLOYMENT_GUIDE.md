# ðŸš€ GitHub Deployment Setup - This Will Work Better

## Why GitHub Deployment is Better
- Netlify can properly build from source files
- Functions will be compiled during build process
- No manual file upload issues
- Better cache management

## Current Status
Your site is still showing a 404 with the same etag from July 11th. This means Netlify isn't processing new deployments properly with manual uploads.

## Files Ready for GitHub
âœ… `netlify.toml` - Fixed configuration
âœ… `dist/public/index.html` - Your gaming profile (6.6KB)
âœ… `dist/functions/api.js` - Backend API (28KB)
âœ… All source files in proper structure

## GitHub Setup Steps

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
- Go to GitHub.com
- Create new repository named "renegaderaider-wtf"
- Don't initialize with README

### 2. Connect Your Repository
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/renegaderaider-wtf.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Connect to Netlify
- Go to Netlify dashboard
- Click "New site from Git"
- Connect your GitHub repository
- Build settings will use your netlify.toml automatically

## What Will Happen
1. Netlify will clone your repository
2. Run the build command from netlify.toml
3. Deploy both static files AND functions
4. Your site will work immediately

## Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in Netlify dashboard:
- DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
- DISCORD_CLIENT_ID
- DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET
- SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID
- SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET
- SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN

GitHub deployment will solve the function deployment issue completely.
