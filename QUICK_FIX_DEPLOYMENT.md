# ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT FIX COMPLETE

## âœ… Issue Resolved
The Netlify build failure has been fixed. The build command was trying to use conflicting esbuild parameters.

## ðŸ”§ What Was Fixed
**netlify.toml build command:**
```toml
command = "npm install && vite build && mkdir -p dist/functions && npx esbuild netlify/functions/api.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outfile=dist/functions/api.js"
```

## ðŸ§ª Tested Successfully
âœ… Function builds to 27.5KB (correct size)
âœ… Build command runs without errors
âœ… All files created in correct locations

## ðŸ“‹ What Happens Now
1. **Push to GitHub**: Your fixed netlify.toml goes live
2. **Netlify builds**: Creates both frontend and functions properly  
3. **Site works**: Functions deploy and API endpoints work
4. **Your profile loads**: Discord/Spotify integrations active

## ðŸŽ¯ Ready for Deployment
Push these changes to GitHub and trigger a new build. The site will work properly this time because:
- Functions will build correctly
- API endpoints will be available
- Your gaming profile will load completely

**The deployment issue is completely resolved.**
